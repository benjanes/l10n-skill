# Localize

Replace hardcoded user-facing strings in source files with keys that reference a JSON catalog using ICU MessageFormat syntax.

## How it works

1. **Scan** the target file(s) for user-facing strings (UI text, labels, messages, tooltips, error messages shown to users, placeholder text, aria-labels, alt text)
2. **Generate hierarchical keys** based on the file path and component/function context
3. **Replace** each string in the source code with the appropriate localization function call
4. **Write** the extracted strings into a JSON catalog file

## What counts as a user-facing string

Extract these:
- Text rendered in UI (labels, headings, button text, descriptions, placeholder text)
- User-visible error and success messages
- Tooltip and aria-label content
- Alt text for images

Leave these alone:
- Log messages, debug strings, comments
- CSS class names, HTML attributes that aren't user-visible
- URLs, file paths, regex patterns
- Environment variable names, config keys
- Identifiers, enum values, constants used for logic
- Strings used purely for internal comparisons or routing

When in doubt about whether a string is user-facing, err on the side of extracting it — it's easier to remove an unnecessary key than to find a missed string later.

## Key naming convention

Use **hierarchical dot-notation** keys derived from the file path and semantic context:

```
<domain>.<component>.<element>
```

**Examples:**
- `settings.profile.title` — title in the profile section of settings
- `auth.login.submitButton` — submit button on the login form
- `errors.network.timeout` — network timeout error message
- `dashboard.widgets.salesChart.title` — title of the sales chart widget

**Rules:**
- Derive the domain from the file's directory path (e.g., `src/components/settings/` → `settings`)
- Use the component or function name as the middle segment
- Use a descriptive suffix for the specific element (`title`, `description`, `placeholder`, `errorMessage`, `label`, `tooltip`, `altText`)
- Use camelCase for each segment
- Keep keys concise but unambiguous — if two components could collide, add more specificity
- If the repo already has localization keys, match the existing naming convention instead

### Monorepo key naming

In a monorepo with multiple apps or packages, use a two-tier namespace strategy:

1. **Common strings** — generic UI strings that appear across multiple apps (e.g., "Save", "Cancel", "OK", "Delete", "Loading...") go under `common.*`:
   ```
   common.save        → "Save"
   common.cancel      → "Cancel"
   common.delete      → "Delete"
   common.loading     → "Loading..."
   common.errors.notFound → "Not found"
   ```

2. **App-specific strings** — strings unique to a particular app get prefixed with the app name:
   ```
   web.auth.login.title       → "Sign In"
   mobile.profile.editButton  → "Edit Profile"
   api.errors.rateLimited     → "Too many requests"
   ```

**Deduplication rule:** If the exact same English string appears in multiple apps, use one shared key. For common UI verbs and phrases, always check `common.*` first before creating an app-specific key. This keeps the catalog lean and ensures consistent translations across platforms.

**Detecting app names:** To determine what to use as the app prefix:
1. Read the app's config file (`package.json` name field, `build.gradle` app name, Podfile target name, etc.)
2. If no config file gives a clear name, fall back to the directory name (e.g., `packages/web` → `web`, `apps/mobile` → `mobile`)

## Catalog file

Use a **flat JSON** file with dot-notation keys and **ICU MessageFormat** values:

```json
{
  "settings.profile.title": "Profile Settings",
  "settings.profile.description": "Manage your account preferences",
  "auth.login.submitButton": "Sign In",
  "auth.login.placeholder.email": "Enter your email",
  "dashboard.welcomeMessage": "Welcome back, {name}!",
  "cart.itemCount": "{count, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}",
  "profile.greeting": "{gender, select, male {He updated his profile} female {She updated her profile} other {They updated their profile}}"
}
```

### ICU MessageFormat syntax

ICU MessageFormat is the industry standard for translatable strings. It handles interpolation, plurals, and gender/select in a single string — no need for separate key suffixes or special conventions.

**Simple interpolation:** Use `{variableName}` for variable placeholders:
```
"Welcome back, {name}!"
```

**Plurals:** Use `{variable, plural, ...}` when a string varies by count. The `#` symbol is replaced by the count value:
```
"{count, plural, one {# item in your cart} other {# items in your cart}}"
```

**Select (gender, status, etc.):** Use `{variable, select, ...}` when a string varies by a category:
```
"{role, select, admin {Administrator} editor {Editor} other {Viewer}}"
```

**Nested:** ICU supports nesting these constructs:
```
"{gender, select, male {He has {count, plural, one {# notification} other {# notifications}}} female {She has {count, plural, one {# notification} other {# notifications}}} other {They have {count, plural, one {# notification} other {# notifications}}}}"
```

**Auto-detection rules:** When scanning source code, automatically convert these patterns to ICU:
- Ternary or if/else based on a count (e.g., `count === 1 ? "1 item" : \`${count} items\``) → `{count, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}`
- Template literals / f-strings with variables (e.g., `\`Hello, ${name}\``) → `Hello, {name}!`
- Conditional rendering based on a category (e.g., gender, role, status switches) → `{variable, select, ...}`
- A string with a `{count}` / `{number}` / numeric placeholder adjacent to a noun (e.g., `"Archive {count} chats"`) → `{count, plural, one {Archive # chat} other {Archive # chats}}` — even if the source code doesn't branch on the value. Any noun next to a count variable is inherently plural-sensitive.

**Catalog location:**
1. If a catalog file already exists in the repo (look for files like `en.json`, `locale/en.json`, `src/locales/en.json`, `public/locales/en/translation.json`, `i18n/en.json`), use it and append new keys
2. If no catalog exists, create `locales/en.json` at the project root
3. When appending to an existing catalog, preserve all existing keys — never remove or rename keys that are already there
4. Sort keys alphabetically in the output for readability

**Monorepo catalog:** In a monorepo, there is **one shared catalog** for the entire repo — not one per app. Look for an existing catalog in these locations (in order):
1. A dedicated i18n package (e.g., `packages/i18n/locales/en.json`, `packages/shared/i18n/en.json`)
2. The repo root (`locales/en.json`, `i18n/en.json`)
3. If no catalog exists, ask the user where they'd like it. If they don't have a preference, create `locales/en.json` at the repo root

## Framework-specific replacement patterns

The way you replace strings depends on the language and framework. Read the appropriate reference file before making changes:

| Environment | Reference file | When to read it |
|---|---|---|
| React / JS / TS | `references/react-js-ts.md` | `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.ts` files in a React/Next.js/Remix project |
| iOS (Swift) | `references/swift.md` | `.swift` files |
| Android (Kotlin) | `references/kotlin-android.md` | `.kt` files in an Android project |
| Python | `references/python.md` | `.py` files |
| General / Other | `references/general.md` | Anything not covered above |

Before starting, identify the project's framework from `package.json`, `Podfile`, `build.gradle`, `requirements.txt`, or similar config files. Then read only the relevant reference file.

## Workflow

1. **Detect repo structure** — check if this is a monorepo (look for workspace config in root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `lerna.json`, or multiple app directories like `apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`). If it's a monorepo, identify the apps and their frameworks
2. **Determine scope** — if the user pointed at specific files or directories, localize just those. If they said something broad like "localize the repo", scan all apps
3. **Identify the framework(s)** — check project config files to determine the tech stack. In a monorepo, each app may use a different framework — read the appropriate reference file for each
4. **Read the appropriate reference file(s)** from the table above
5. **Check for existing localization setup** — look for existing catalog files, i18n config, or translation imports already in the project. If the project already uses a localization library, use its patterns
6. **Scan target files** for user-facing strings
7. **Generate keys** using the hierarchical naming convention (with app prefixes in a monorepo — see the monorepo key naming section)
8. **Check for duplicates** — before creating a new key, check if the same English string already exists in the catalog. If so, reuse that key. Pay special attention to common UI strings that belong under `common.*`
9. **Replace strings** in source files with the framework-appropriate function call
10. **Update the catalog** — append new key-value pairs to the single JSON catalog (create it if it doesn't exist)
11. **Add necessary imports** — if the replacement pattern requires an import (e.g., `useTranslation` hook), add it to the file
12. **Report** what was done: how many strings extracted, how many were deduplicated, which files modified, where the catalog was written. In a monorepo, break down the report by app

## Important considerations

- **String interpolation**: When a string contains template literals or variable interpolation (e.g., `` `Hello, ${name}` ``), use ICU `{variableName}` syntax in the catalog value and pass the variable as a parameter to the translation function.
- **Plurals**: If a string varies by count (e.g., "1 item" vs "5 items"), use ICU plural syntax: `{count, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}`. Do NOT use separate keys with suffixes — ICU handles it in a single key.
- **Select/Gender**: If a string varies by a category (gender, role, status), use ICU select syntax: `{variable, select, value1 {text} value2 {text} other {text}}`.
- **Context**: If the same English word means different things in different places (e.g., "Post" as a noun vs verb), use distinct keys to allow translators to provide different translations.
- **JSX**: In JSX, strings inside `{}` expressions AND bare text children both need extraction. The `<Trans>` component handles JSX with embedded elements — read the React reference for details.
- **Don't break logic**: If a string is used in a comparison (e.g., `if (status === "active")`), that's a logic string, not a user-facing one. Leave it alone even if it looks like English text.
- **Escaping in ICU**: Literal curly braces in text must be escaped with single quotes: `"Use '{' and '}' for objects"`. A literal single quote is `''`.
- **Wire interpolation values through**: Every `{placeholder}` in the catalog must have a corresponding values argument at the call site. Without it, the placeholder renders as literal text (e.g., `{name}` instead of "Alice"). This is especially easy to miss when i18n keys are stored as data (config objects, arrays, preference definitions) rather than called inline — the data structure needs a field for interpolation values, and the renderer must forward them. Before finishing, search the catalog for all `{...}` placeholders and verify each one has values wired through the rendering path. See the framework-specific reference files for detailed examples.
