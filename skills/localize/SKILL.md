# Localize

Replace hardcoded user-facing strings in source files with keys that reference a JSON catalog using ICU MessageFormat syntax.

## How it works

1. **Analyze** — ensure string patterns have been cataloged (run auditing-i18n-string-patterns if needed)
2. **Generate hierarchical keys** based on the file path and component/function context
3. **Replace** each string in the source code with the appropriate translation function call
4. **Write** the extracted strings into a JSON catalog file

## Prerequisite: String pattern analysis

Before extraction, the codebase's strings must be inventoried and their construction patterns cataloged. Check for `i18n-extraction-pattern-catalog.md` in the project root. If it doesn't exist, you must run auditing-i18n-string-patterns on the specified path(s), specified domain/view or the entire project if not specificed. Do not analyze on your own, you must use the catalogs.

The pattern catalog (`i18n-extraction-pattern-catalog.md`) provides:
- What string construction patterns exist (template literals, ternaries, plurals, select switches, fragment assembly)
- How to convert each pattern to ICU MessageFormat
- Gotchas and edge cases per pattern type
- Cross-cutting concerns (ICU escaping, wiring interpolation values through)

The pre-extraction report (`i18n-pre-extraction-fixes.md`) provides:
- Tech stack and frameworks in use
- Scope metrics (how many strings, where, what's already localized)
- String density heatmap (which files have the most strings)

## Key naming convention

Use **hierarchical dot-notation** keys derived from the file path and semantic context:

```
<domain>.<component>.<element>
```

**Examples:**
- `settings.profile.title` — title in the profile section of settings
- `auth.login.submitButton` — submit button on the login form
- `errors.network.timeout` — network timeout error message
- `dashboard.widgets.salesChart.title` — title of the sales chart widget

**Rules:**
- Derive the domain from the file's directory path (e.g., `src/components/settings/` → `settings`)
- Use the component or function name as the middle segment
- Use a descriptive suffix for the specific element (`title`, `description`, `placeholder`, `errorMessage`, `label`, `tooltip`, `altText`)
- Use camelCase for each segment
- Keep keys concise but unambiguous — if two components could collide, add more specificity
- If the repo already has translation keys, match the existing naming convention instead

### Monorepo key naming

In a monorepo with multiple apps or packages, use a two-tier namespace strategy:

1. **Common strings** — generic UI strings that appear across multiple apps (e.g., "Save", "Cancel", "OK", "Delete", "Loading...") go under `common.*`:
   ```
   common.save        → "Save"
   common.cancel      → "Cancel"
   common.delete      → "Delete"
   common.loading     → "Loading..."
   common.errors.notFound → "Not found"
   ```

2. **App-specific strings** — strings unique to a particular app get prefixed with the app name:
   ```
   web.auth.login.title       → "Sign In"
   mobile.profile.editButton  → "Edit Profile"
   api.errors.rateLimited     → "Too many requests"
   ```

**Deduplication rule:** If the exact same English string appears in multiple apps, use one shared key. For common UI verbs and phrases, always check `common.*` first before creating an app-specific key. This keeps the catalog lean and ensures consistent translations across platforms.

**Detecting app names:** To determine what to use as the app prefix:
1. Read the app's config file (`package.json` name field, `build.gradle` app name, Podfile target name, etc.)
2. If no config file gives a clear name, fall back to the directory name (e.g., `packages/web` → `web`, `apps/mobile` → `mobile`)

## Catalog file

Use a **flat JSON** file with dot-notation keys and **ICU MessageFormat** values:

```json
{
  "settings.profile.title": "Profile Settings",
  "settings.profile.description": "Manage your account preferences",
  "auth.login.submitButton": "Sign In",
  "auth.login.placeholder.email": "Enter your email",
  "dashboard.welcomeMessage": "Welcome back, {name}!",
  "cart.itemCount": "{count, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}",
  "profile.greeting": "{gender, select, male {He updated his profile} female {She updated her profile} other {They updated their profile}}"
}
```

### ICU MessageFormat syntax

ICU MessageFormat is the industry standard for translatable strings. It handles interpolation, plurals, and gender/select in a single string — no need for separate key suffixes or special conventions.

**Simple interpolation:** Use `{variableName}` for variable placeholders:
```
"Welcome back, {name}!"
```

**Plurals:** Use `{variable, plural, ...}` when a string varies by count. The `#` symbol is replaced by the count value:
```
"{count, plural, one {# item in your cart} other {# items in your cart}}"
```

**Select (gender, status, etc.):** Use `{variable, select, ...}` when a string varies by a category:
```
"{role, select, admin {Administrator} editor {Editor} other {Viewer}}"
```

**Nested:** ICU supports nesting these constructs:
```
"{gender, select, male {He has {count, plural, one {# notification} other {# notifications}}} female {She has {count, plural, one {# notification} other {# notifications}}} other {They have {count, plural, one {# notification} other {# notifications}}}}"
```

**Catalog location:**
1. If a catalog file already exists in the repo (look for files like `en.json`, `locale/en.json`, `src/locales/en.json`, `public/locales/en/translation.json`, `i18n/en.json`), use it and append new keys
2. If no catalog exists, create `locales/en.json` at the project root
3. When appending to an existing catalog, preserve all existing keys — never remove or rename keys that are already there
4. Sort keys alphabetically in the output for readability

**Monorepo catalog:** In a monorepo, there is **one shared catalog** for the entire repo — not one per app. Look for an existing catalog in these locations (in order):
1. A dedicated i18n package (e.g., `packages/i18n/locales/en.json`, `packages/shared/i18n/en.json`)
2. The repo root (`locales/en.json`, `i18n/en.json`)
3. If no catalog exists, ask the user where they'd like it. If they don't have a preference, create `locales/en.json` at the repo root

## Framework-specific replacement patterns

The way you replace strings depends on the language and framework. Read the appropriate reference file before making changes:

| Environment | Reference file | When to read it |
|---|---|---|
| React / JS / TS | `references/react-js-ts.md` | `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.ts` files in a React/Next.js/Remix project |
| iOS (Swift) | `references/swift.md` | `.swift` files |
| Android (Kotlin) | `references/kotlin-android.md` | `.kt` files in an Android project |
| Python | `references/python.md` | `.py` files |
| General / Other | `references/general.md` | Anything not covered above |

Use the tech stack from the pre-extraction report to select the right reference file. Then read only the relevant one.

## Workflow

1. **Check for pattern catalog** — if `i18n-extraction-pattern-catalog.md` doesn't exist, run auditing-i18n-string-patterns on the target path(s) (or the entire repo if no paths were specified)
2. **Read the reports** — read both `i18n-extraction-pattern-catalog.md` and `i18n-pre-extraction-fixes.md` for tech stack, scope metrics, string inventory, and pattern conversion recipes
3. **Check for blockers** — scan the pre-extraction report for any findings marked **Blocker** severity. If blockers exist, list them for the user and strongly recommend fixing them before proceeding with extraction — these are issues (hardcoded locales, hardcoded currency symbols, etc.) that will produce incorrect results for non-English users even after strings are extracted. Do not refuse to proceed, but make the risk clear and get acknowledgment before continuing.
4. **Determine scope** — if the user pointed at specific files or directories, localize just those. If they said something broad like "localize the repo", use the full string inventory from the reports
5. **Read the appropriate reference file(s)** from the table above — use the tech stack from the pre-extraction report to select the right one
6. **Check for existing localization setup** — look for existing catalog files, i18n config, or translation imports. If the project already uses a localization library, use its patterns
7. **Generate keys** using the hierarchical naming convention (with app prefixes in a monorepo — see the monorepo key naming section)
8. **Check for duplicates** — before creating a new key, check if the same English string already exists in the catalog. If so, reuse that key. Pay special attention to common UI strings that belong under `common.*`
9. **Replace strings** in source files with the framework-appropriate function call — use the pattern catalog's conversion recipes for template literals, ternaries, plurals, select patterns, and other non-trivial constructions
10. **Update the catalog** — append new key-value pairs to the single JSON catalog (create it if it doesn't exist)
11. **Add necessary imports** — if the replacement pattern requires an import (e.g., `useTranslation` hook), add it to the file
12. **Report** what was done: how many strings extracted, how many were deduplicated, which files modified, where the catalog was written. In a monorepo, break down the report by app

## Important considerations

- **Context**: If the same English word means different things in different places (e.g., "Post" as a noun vs verb), use distinct keys to allow translators to provide different translations.
- **JSX**: In JSX, strings inside `{}` expressions AND bare text children both need extraction. The `<Trans>` component handles JSX with embedded elements — read the React reference for details.
- **Don't break logic**: If a string is used in a comparison (e.g., `if (status === "active")`), that's a logic string, not a user-facing one. Leave it alone even if it looks like English text.
- **Escaping in ICU**: Literal curly braces in text must be escaped with single quotes: `"Use '{' and '}' for objects"`. A literal single quote is `''`.
- **Wire interpolation values through**: Every `{placeholder}` in the catalog must have a corresponding values argument at the call site. Without it, the placeholder renders as literal text (e.g., `{name}` instead of "Alice"). This is especially easy to miss when i18n keys are stored as data (config objects, arrays, preference definitions) rather than called inline — the data structure needs a field for interpolation values, and the renderer must forward them. Before finishing, search the catalog for all `{...}` placeholders and verify each one has values wired through the rendering path. See the framework-specific reference files for detailed examples.
