# Localization Audit Skills — Design Spec

## Problem

Preparing a client app for localization requires significant upfront analysis before string extraction begins. Without it, teams extract strings that are structurally broken (concatenated fragments, naive pluralization), tonally inconsistent, or terminologically messy — leading to rework, poor translations, and brand inconsistency across locales.

Today, this audit process is manual and ad hoc. There is no structured, repeatable skill that guides a Claude Code agent through a comprehensive localization readiness assessment.

## Solution

Four Claude Code skills that guide an agent through a structured localization audit of any codebase. Each skill addresses a distinct analysis concern, produces findings in a shared markdown report, and is independently invocable.

## Architecture

### Skill Set

| Skill | Purpose | Runs after |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `auditing-i18n-scope` | Discover hardcoded copy, detect already-localized strings, assess scale | (first) |
| `auditing-i18n-readiness` | Identify structural blockers for localization | scope |
| `auditing-i18n-tone` | Assess brand/tone consistency and cultural risks | scope |
| `auditing-i18n-terminology` | Ensure vocabulary consistency, build proto-glossary | scope |

### Dependency Model

```
auditing-i18n-scope (produces string inventory + tech stack context)
       │
       ▼
auditing-i18n-readiness  ┐
auditing-i18n-tone       ├── consume scope output, run in any order
auditing-i18n-terminology┘
```

The scope skill is a soft dependency. If a downstream skill runs without scope output, it performs lightweight string discovery on its own rather than failing.

### Shared Report

All skills append to `i18n-audit-report.md` in the target repo root:

```markdown
# Localization Audit Report

## Tech Stack & Configuration
<!-- auditing-i18n-scope -->

## 1. Scope Assessment
<!-- auditing-i18n-scope -->

## 2. Readiness Issues

### Framework Agnosticism

Skills adapt to the detected tech stack. Supported ecosystems:
- **Web:** React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, plain HTML/JS
- **iOS:** Swift, Objective-C (UIKit, SwiftUI, Storyboards)
- **Android:** Kotlin, Java (XML layouts, Compose)
- **Other:** Any codebase with identifiable UI-rendering code

Detection heuristics are stack-specific but the analysis process is universal.

## Skill 1: `auditing-i18n-scope`

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: auditing-i18n-scope
description: Use when preparing a codebase for localization, beginning an i18n initiative, or assessing the scale of hardcoded copy before string extraction
---
```

### Process

**Phase 1: Detect tech stack**
- Identify languages, frameworks, templating systems
- Check for existing i18n setup (i18next, react-intl, vue-i18n, .strings, strings.xml, .arb, etc.)
- Write findings to report "Tech Stack & Configuration" section

**Phase 2: Identify UI surface area**
- Find all files that render user-facing content
- Components, views, templates, storyboards, XIBs, layout XML
- Establish the search perimeter; exclude test files, build output, node_modules

**Phase 3: Detect already-localized strings**
- Find strings using i18n library calls: `t('key')`, `NSLocalizedString`, `getString(R.string.x)`, `$t('key')`, `intl.formatMessage`, etc.
- Catalog as "already localized"

**Phase 4: Scan for hardcoded strings**
- Within UI surface area, find all string literals that appear user-facing
- Filter out non-user-facing strings: log messages, error codes, debug output, CSS classes, route paths, event names, identifiers, config values
- Stack-specific heuristics:
  - **JSX/TSX:** text content between tags, `placeholder=`, `aria-label=`, `title=`, `alt=`
  - **Swift/ObjC:** bare string literals in UI code (not `NSLocalizedString`), storyboard text
  - **Kotlin/Java:** `setText()`, `setTitle()`, XML `android:text=`, `android:hint=`
  - **Templates (Vue/Angular/Svelte):** text interpolation, attribute bindings with string values
  - **General:** string arguments to UI-rendering functions

**Phase 5: Categorize findings**
- By location: file, component/view, screen/feature area
- By type: labels, buttons, headings, body text, error messages, placeholders, tooltips, a11y text
- By confidence: high (clearly user-facing), medium (likely), low (uncertain)

**Phase 6: Generate scope metrics**
- Total string count with confidence breakdown
- Localized vs. hardcoded ratio (done vs. remaining)
- File count and density heatmap (files ordered by string count)
- Breakdown by string type
- Breakdown by feature area (if discernible from directory/component structure)

**Phase 7: Write to report**
- Append "Tech Stack & Configuration" and "Scope Assessment" sections
- Include summary tables, metrics, file heatmap
- Contribute initial items to "Recommended Next Steps"

### Output Example

```markdown
## 1. Scope Assessment

**Summary:** 847 hardcoded strings across 62 files. 23 strings already localized (3%).

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total user-facing strings | 870 |
| Already localized | 23 (3%) |
| Hardcoded (high confidence) | 612 |
| Hardcoded (medium confidence) | 189 |
| Hardcoded (low confidence) | 46 |
| Files with hardcoded strings | 62 |

### String Density Heatmap (top 10 files)
| File | Strings | Type |
|------|---------|------|
| src/components/Dashboard.tsx | 47 | labels, headings, buttons |
| src/pages/Settings.tsx | 38 | labels, descriptions |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Breakdown by Type
| Type | Count | % |
|------|-------|---|
| Button labels | 156 | 18% |
| Headings | 89 | 11% |
| Body text | 203 | 24% |
| Error messages | 134 | 16% |
| Placeholders | 78 | 9% |
| Tooltips | 45 | 5% |
| A11y text | 142 | 17% |
```

## Skill 2: `auditing-i18n-readiness`

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: auditing-i18n-readiness
description: Use when assessing localization blockers — structural issues like string concatenation, naive pluralization, hardcoded formatting, or missing translator context that must be fixed before string extraction
---
```

### Process

**Phase 1: Load context**
- Read scope output from `i18n-audit-report.md` (tech stack, string inventory)
- If scope hasn't run, perform lightweight string discovery

**Phase 2: Analyze string construction**
- **Concatenation:** `"Hello, " + name + "!"` — breaks word order for other languages
- **Interpolation with embedded logic:** `{count > 1 ? "items" : "item"}` — naive pluralization
- **Sentence fragments assembled from parts:** building sentences from separate string variables
- Severity rating for each pattern:
  - **Blocker:** must fix before extraction (concatenation building sentences, naive pluralization)
  - **Warning:** should fix (minor interpolation issues)
  - **Info:** worth noting (unusual but not blocking)

**Phase 3: Detect pluralization patterns**
- Simple if/else or ternary (problematic — many languages have 3-6 plural forms)
- Array indexing or switch statements (partially handles plurals)
- Already using a pluralization library (good)
- No pluralization at all (needs assessment — does the app show counts?)

**Phase 4: Check formatting patterns**
- Hardcoded date formats (`MM/DD/YYYY`, `toLocaleDateString()` without locale arg)
- Hardcoded number formatting (`toFixed(2)`, manual comma insertion)
- Hardcoded currency symbols (`$`, `€`) or positions
- Hardcoded measurement units

**Phase 5: Scan for non-code localizable content**
- Images/SVGs with embedded text (require asset variants per locale)
- Hardcoded text in CSS (`content: "..."`)
- Accessibility attributes with hardcoded text (`aria-label`, `alt`, `title`)
- Placeholder and title attributes with hardcoded text

**Phase 6: Assess translator context**
- Are strings isolated or grouped by feature?
- Ambiguous strings that need context notes ("Post", "Save", "Set" — verb or noun?)
- Strings with interpolated variables where the variable's meaning isn't clear to translators

**Phase 7: Write to report**
- Append "Readiness Issues" section with:
  - Issues table: pattern, severity, count, example locations
  - Remediation recommendations per issue category
  - Estimated effort indicators (small/medium/large) per category
- Contribute items to "Recommended Next Steps"

## Skill 3: `auditing-i18n-tone`

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: auditing-i18n-tone
description: Use when auditing copy for brand and tone consistency before localization — identifies voice deviations, cultural risks, and style guide mismatches across user-facing strings
---
```

### Process

**Phase 1: Load context**
- Read scope output for string inventory
- Search for brand/style guide documents in repo: `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `brand-guidelines.*`, `content-guide.*`, docs directories, design system docs

**Phase 2: Establish baseline tone profile**
- Sample representative cross-section of strings (across features, string types)
- Characterize dominant tone along dimensions:
  - **Formality:** casual ↔ formal
  - **Warmth:** friendly/personal ↔ neutral/institutional
  - **Directness:** concise/imperative ↔ verbose/explanatory
  - **Technical level:** plain language ↔ jargon-heavy
- Present as the "de facto voice" of the app

**Phase 3: Detect tone deviations**
- Error messages that are suddenly harsh or overly technical
- Marketing-style language in functional UI
- Inconsistent formality levels across screens (casual onboarding vs. formal settings)
- Passive voice in a codebase that's otherwise direct
- Overly casual copy in serious contexts (financial, medical, legal)

**Phase 4: Brand guideline comparison (conditional)**
- If brand/style guide documents are found: compare de facto voice against documented guidelines
- Flag systematic mismatches (e.g., guidelines say "friendly and casual" but error messages are "formal and terse")
- If no guidelines found: note this as a recommendation (create guidelines before localizing)

**Phase 5: Identify localization risks from tone**
- Humor, idioms, colloquialisms (often don't translate well or may be offensive)
- Culture-specific references (sports metaphors, holidays, social norms)
- Emotional language that may land differently across cultures
- Slang or informal contractions

**Phase 6: Write to report**
- Append "Tone & Brand Analysis" section with:
  - Baseline tone profile summary
  - Deviations table: string, location, expected tone, actual tone, severity
  - Localization risk items with specific strings flagged
  - Recommendations for standardization before extraction
- Contribute items to "Recommended Next Steps"

## Skill 4: `auditing-i18n-terminology`

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: auditing-i18n-terminology
description: Use when auditing vocabulary consistency before localization — finds synonyms used for the same concept, ambiguous terms, and builds a proto-glossary for translators
---
```

### Process

**Phase 1: Load context**
- Read scope output for string inventory and tech stack context

**Phase 2: Extract key terms**
- **Action labels:** button text, menu items, link text ("Save", "Submit", "Delete", "Cancel")
- **Navigation labels:** tab names, section headers, breadcrumbs
- **Status/state words:** "Loading", "Error", "Success", "Pending", "Active", "Disabled"
- **Domain-specific nouns:** what the app calls its core entities (e.g., "project" vs. "workspace" vs. "space")

**Phase 3: Group by semantic intent**
- Cluster terms that convey the same meaning
- Example: "Delete" / "Remove" / "Trash" / "Discard" for the same destructive action
- Example: "Save" / "Submit" / "Apply" / "Confirm" for completion actions
- Present each cluster with the contexts where each variant appears

**Phase 4: Detect inconsistencies**
- **Same concept, different words:** "Settings" in one place, "Preferences" in another
- **Same word, different meanings:** "Post" as a noun (blog post) and verb (submit) — critical for translator context
- **Unnecessary variation:** "Sign in" vs "Log in" vs "Login" across the app
- **Contextual mismatches:** using "Delete" for soft-delete and hard-delete without distinction

**Phase 5: Build proto-glossary**
- For each semantic cluster, recommend a canonical term:
  - Most frequently used term (momentum/consistency), OR
  - Most precise/clear term (if the frequent one is ambiguous)
- Include translator context notes: what does this term mean in this app?
- Flag terms that will need special handling in translation (polysemous words, technical terms)

**Phase 6: Write to report**
- Append "Terminology Consistency" section with:
  - Inconsistency table: concept, variants found, locations, recommended canonical term
  - Proto-glossary for localization team
  - Ambiguous terms requiring translator context notes
- Contribute items to "Recommended Next Steps"

## Success Criteria

1. **Skill loading:** Each skill appears in Claude Code's skill list and loads when relevant triggers match the description
2. **Independent execution:** Each skill runs standalone; downstream skills perform lightweight discovery if scope hasn't run
3. **Sequential execution:** Running scope → readiness → tone → terminology produces a coherent, non-duplicative report
4. **Framework adaptation:** Skills adapt detection heuristics to the detected tech stack
5. **Report quality:** Output is structured, actionable, includes severity ratings and next-step recommendations
6. **Actionable findings:** Every issue in the report includes enough context (location, example, severity) for a developer to act on it

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Automated string extraction (separate future skill)
- RTL layout analysis (requires runtime/visual analysis)
- Text expansion simulation (requires design tooling)
- Gender/grammatical agreement analysis (requires linguistic knowledge beyond static analysis)
- Integration with translation management systems
- Automated fixes or refactoring
